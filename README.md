# Homework1 for Pirple nodeJs course

This is a RESTful JSON API that listens on port 3003. When someone posts anything to the route /hello, it will return a welcome message, in JSON format. If you post to any other path it will return 404.

For this project I used NodeJs with TypeScript transpiled by Webpack. There is also Docker support.
To run the project just run "npm run start".

Use it with caution :)
